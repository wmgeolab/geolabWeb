<h3 style="margin-top:-0.25em;">For William & Mary Students:</h3>
<a href="https://forms.gle/tRKMwTNbsfr3f11n9">
<span style="color:black;border:1px dotted gray; padding:5px;">W&M STUDENTS: APPLY HERE</span>
</a>
<h6>The Process</h6>
<p>Each semester, students can apply to be a member on one of our four teams - geoData, geoParsing, geoBoundaries and geoDev.&#160; Applicants go through a two-stage process, filling out an online form and then (if selected) going through a short in-person meeting with the team lead for the geo team you are interested in joining.&#160; Selection is very competitive - we generally get about 20 applicants for each individual we admit into the lab; you will generally hear back from us at the end of the semester in which you apply.&#160; The application form can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5gJhpjflGEnzGd4X7pof90nZSbS4hzVV_zUFF9ZZ-T4GICw/viewform?vc=0&amp;c=0&amp;w=1">here</a>.</p>
<h6>The Commitment</h6>
<p>Students in the geoLab are expected to work a minimum of 4 hours a week with their team, generally as a part of a weekly team meeting.&#160; Students who opt to do so can participate at a higher number of hours as a part of semester-long projects (for course credit or, in some cases, paid), but such additional commitments are always optional.&#160; In addition, students are expected to attend at least one orientation session at the beginning of their time with the lab.</p>
<h6>The Benefits</h6>
<p>In addition to providing an opportunity to get real-world research experience during your time at William and Mary, students that join the lab have access to the following resources and opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to apply to geoFellowships, semester-long research opportunities working with external groups to analyze spatial data (see past examples of these opportunities <a href="/as/data-science/researchlabs/geolab/student_research/index">here</a>).</li>
<li>Unique summer internship opportunities with partners of the geoLab (see where past students have gone <a href="../student_accolades/index.php">here</a>).</li>
<li>Access to the geoLab space in ISC 1109, equipped with desktop computers (multi-monitor), workspaces, a beanbag, and the biggest television on campus.&#160; Steps away from Starbucks.</li>
<li>Your name on citations for any datasets released by your team in the year(s) in which you participated.</li>
<li>Ability to move into leadership roles in the lab, including Team Leads of each project.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top:-0.25em;">For Everyone:</h3>
You can help in four ways:
<ul>
    <li><b><a href="mailto:danr@wm.edu">Partner with us on Applied Projects.</a></b> We engage in partnerships with federal and international agencies, in both funded and unfunded capacities.  Our core goal is to enable our students experiential opportunities to learn through regular interaction with external groups.  Have a tractable, well defined problem our students might benefit from?  <a href="mailto:danr@wm.edu">Contact us.</a></li>
    <li><b><a href="https://github.com/wmgeolab/geoBoundaries#getting-involved">Contribute to our Open Data.</a></b> We maintain the <a href="www.geoboundaries.org">largest boundary dataset in the world</a>, but we don't do it alone.  Anyone with GIS experience can help us improve the geoBoundaries dataset - learn more <a href="https://github.com/wmgeolab/geoBoundaries#getting-involved">here.</a></li>
    <li><b><a href="https://giving.wm.edu/give-now/#allocation=4674">Sponsor a geoFellow.</a></b> Every year, we fund student fellowships for a selection of students within the lab; these fellows take leadership roles across our portfolio of projects.  Fellowships provide financial benefits directly to undergraduate students at William & Mary, generally around $1000 an academic year.</li>
    <li><b><a href="https://giving.wm.edu/give-now/#allocation=4674">Buy us a pizza.</a></b> You would be shocked how much we can get done with pizza as an incentive.</li>

<h3 style="margin-top:-0.25em;" id="cci">For Students Enrolled in a College located within the Commonwealth of Virginia:</h3>
<h6 class="content_button_with_arrow"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkNqF46RgnREVtiamIQsQIIIsWgSDA9sL14s6cnaIzQc_Qfg/viewform?usp=sf_link">Apply Now</a></h6>
<h6>The Program</h6>
<p>In collaboration with the <a href="https://cyberinitiative.org/">Commonwealth Cyber Initiative</a>, the William &amp; Mary geoLab will be hosting the the <strong>SG-PRIZE</strong> for students enrolled in programs of higher education in Virginia during AY 2021 - 2022.&#160; Selected fellows will have the opportunity to work directly with practitioners in the intelligence community and from silicon valley on a project examining one of three focal areas: (a) predicting hospital loads from satellite data; (b) predicting school test scores with satellite data; and (c) 'data poisoning' - the act of intentionally changing data to manipulate algorithms.&#160; Accepted students will be given training on how to create robust algorithms for data production (focusing on estimating road quality from high resolution satellite data using convolutional neural networks), as well as access to the William &amp; Mary High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster to implement novel algorithms. In a team environment - with teams led by real-world practitioners - you'll learn both approaches to data poisoning and counter-poisoning strategies.</p>
<h6>The Process</h6>
<p>We are soliciting applications to the 2021 - 2022 CCI geoFellowship program until November 29th, 2021.&#160; Award recepients will be notified by mid-December.&#160;&#160; Students selected for engagement will become eligible for monetary support from a prize pool over $12,500, pending participation and success in the program.  The top performing team in each of the three focal areas will receive a prize of $2000.</p>
<h6>Requirements</h6>
<ul>
<li>Enrolled in an institution of higher education in Virginia during Fall '21 and Spring '22</li>
<li>Taken and passed at least one course that taught python programming (in computer science or another discipline).</li>
</ul>
<h6>The Commitment</h6>
<ul>
<li><strong>January 2021</strong> - 3-hour zoom kickoff event!&#160; Get your login credentials working for our cluster, spin up your first convolutional neural network on a GPU, and meet your teammates.</li>
<li><strong>Feb-Mar 2021</strong> - Bi-weekly team meetings focused on building prototype CNNs based on data being collected in near-real-time from android phone applications.</li>
<li><strong>Mar-Apr 2021</strong> - Kaggle competition to see who can build the best CNN!</li>
<li><strong>May 2021</strong> - Report and presentation to policy community.</li>
<li><strong>Summer 2021</strong> - Prizes awarded.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above, we will hold monthly all-team meetings on or around the last day of every month, starting in March of 2021.</p>
<h6>The Benefits</h6>
<p>In addition to providing an opportunity to get real-world research experience during your time as a fellow, students that are selected will have access to the following resources and opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prize pool (monetary rewards), dependent on your performance throughout the project.</li>
<li>Unique summer internship opportunities with partners of the geoLab.</li>
<li>If you're on-campus at William &amp; Mary, access to the geoLab space in ISC 1109, equipped with desktop computers (multi-monitor), workspaces, a beanbag, and the biggest television on campus.&#160; Steps away from Starbucks.</li>
